/**
 * Immediately destroys GameObject upon creation. Can optionally exclude object from final builds.  
 * Can be used to create live guides and editor guides. Can be placed on any GameObject, including
 * a folder: all child objects will affected as well.
 * 
 * Live Guide
 * A live guide is a visual GameObject that provides placement information to the game at runtime,
 * but does not appear to the player. Reference the guide in another GameObject, and during that
 * object's Awake(), make a copy of the guides's transform elements you need (e.g., position). 
 * The guide will be destroyed before Start() occurs.
 * 
 * Editor Guide
 * An editor guide is a visual GameObject that can be used to help align objects in the editor,
 * but does not appear to the player. Unlike live guides, editor guides are excluded from final
 * builds, so you cannot reference the guide's position like you can with a live guide. To make
 * this a live guide, check the excludeFromBuild box. This will tag the guide as EditorOnly.
 * 
 * To prevent accidental referencing of an editor guide, move AutoDestroy to the front of the 
 * script execution order.
